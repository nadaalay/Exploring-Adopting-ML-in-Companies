# Exploring Adopting Machine Learning in Companies


## Overview

Interest in machine learning field has grown over the years, and many companies are aware of benefits of machine learning technologies. Research and development in machine learning are expensive, and the intelligence needed to create and train the model is intimidating. Despite these difficulties, some companies are trying to invest in machine learning, because they believe that adopting machine learning lead to bigger competitive advantages. While the other companies are still fear that machine learning is out of reach for them. The degrees of machine learning utilization in the companies are different. Some companies use machine learning for only getting insights from the data and some of them create and deploy machine learning models in production.

This project will take us on a journey to learn about the work environments that differ in the way of adopting machine learning. We will also get to know the skills and experiences of the companies' employees. The notebook will benefit both people who want to learn more about the machine learning adoptions in work environments and the companies that want to start to use machine learning.

The project is organized as the following: it starts with taking a look at the dataset of Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey. Then, we will see how the companies adopt machine learning. After that, we will explore the employees' machine learning experience and skills, and the companies environments.

## File Descriptions 

	- One notebook file `exploring-adopting-ml-in-companies.ipynb` for analysis.
	- `kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv` Kaggle survey 2020 responses. Responses to multiple choice questions.
